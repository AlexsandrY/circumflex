<p>Circumflex is a set of mini-frameworks and tiny helpers for quick and robust application
   development using <a href="http://scala-lang.org" target="_blank">Scala programming language</a>.
</p>
<p>Circumflex features two mini-frameworks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/core">Circumflex Web Framework</a></li>
  <li><a href="/orm">Circumflex ORM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These framework provide Domain-Specific Languages that make the development process
   natural and extremely productive.</p>
<p>Circumflex does not contain a comprehensive features list for every task a developer
   might ever need; instead it allows developers to choose the tools and libraries that
   best suit their particular needs.</p>
<p>Circumflex is designed to use the powers of Scala programming language and
  <a href="http://maven.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Maven 2</a> software management
   platform â€“ these are the only assumptions Circumflex makes about your applications.</p>
<p>Circumflex has several key concepts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The application should not be burried in an endless pile of configuration files, that
      are supposed to be maintained by non-programmer kinds. Circumflex components require minimum
      initial configuration, while still allowing developers to easily override defaults if necessary.</li>
  <li>Scala applications are easily integrated with Java libraries, but it is often very
      inconveniant to use them from Scala code. Circumflex helpers for popular Java tools are
      intended to eliminate these complexities.</li>
  <li>All Circumflex components are relied on Scala support for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).
      They can make the development process more natural and effective.</li>
</ul>
